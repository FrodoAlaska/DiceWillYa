# TODO 

- STOP! PLAY SIMILIAR GOD DAMN GAMES, IDIOT! We cannot just beautify an incomplete prototype. 

# Beautify For Playtesters

- Get a better background 
- Better UI layout 
- A menu screen for instructions... or maybe a tutorial mode? 
- The main menu is a tavern sign with the game's name?

- Shuffle between the music during gameplay

# Design Ideas

- I don't know, dude, I just love the vibe. The music, the sound effects... everything about it is so fucking amazing. I think it's super fun to play the game. I can lose myself in hours just playing it over and over again. But, with that being said, I really think there needs to be a reason to keep going. Racking up score is cool, but maybe we can at least buy new dice with that score. Perhaps _everytime we get a certain amount of score, we get a wad of coins. We can use these coins to buy something. Abilities, dice, or something else_. 

- Just make it simple, man. I don't need to make something that's huge. This is only my _first_ commercial game. It doesn't have to be a hit. I don't have to add all that complexity. Even with this shity setup, the game is _super_ fucking fun. So, please, just make it simple and revel in the simplicity. Do not make a rogue-like, with a life sim, and some economy management sliced in. Just make a fun and relaxing game with some nice motherfucking medieval tavern music.

- Maybe this is round based? Hear me out. Every round has a certain number of points you'll have to get. After each round, you can choose to buy a certain dice that will have some kind of ability. A dice that always rolls a one? Or perhaps any specific number? An all-in-one dice that will just clear the whole entire hand? That kind of a thing. However, if you get too many farkles, you will eventually lose the round, prompting you to start over from nothing. So, fucking balatro. Fuck. Fuck you.

- High score mode? (Probably should be the default until we can make sure this game is _actually_ fun)

- Combos when getting threes, fours, etc? 

- Mutiple dice types that give you different abilities?
