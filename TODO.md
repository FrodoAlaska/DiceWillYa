# Design Ideas

- Perk ideas: 
    - A guaranteed no farkle after a roll
    - Always roll a one
    - Guaranteed three dice of the same kind each roll
    - A joker that will clear the hand right away when picked
    - Double the points when banking, or doing anything really

- Just make it simple, man. I don't need to make something that's huge. This is only my _first_ commercial game. It doesn't have to be a hit. I don't have to add all that complexity. Even with this shity setup, the game is _super_ fucking fun. So, please, just make it simple and revel in the simplicity. Do not make a rogue-like, with a life sim, and some economy management sliced in. Just make a fun and relaxing game with some nice motherfucking medieval tavern music.
