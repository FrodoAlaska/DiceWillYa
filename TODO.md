# TODO 

- Better game HUD layout 
    - [] Progress bar for the next rank 
    - [] Keep the instructions in a seperate menu, not cluttered in the game's HUD 
    - [] Little boxes for both the unbanked and banked points
    - [] A little dice indicating the rolls left in this turn
- A sound effect for the ranked action

- Better farkle animation
- Get a better background 
- Shuffle between the music during gameplay

- State manager
- A menu screen for instructions... or maybe a tutorial mode? 
- The main menu is a tavern sign with the game's name?

# Design Ideas

- Brainrot: The Game... great. What a great time to be a game developer. 

- More like vampire survivors? Like a bullet hell? The points count towards leveling up, which in turn with give you perks. Let's suppose that after every level-up you get to choose between a certain number of abilities. Perks, if you will. You can only have one of these perks at a time (maybe there is a perk that lets you choose multiple perks). Each perk will grant a certain ability that can in turn help you level up more and more. 

- I don't know, dude, I just love the vibe. The music, the sound effects... everything about it is so fucking amazing. I think it's super fun to play the game. I can lose myself in hours just playing it over and over again. But, with that being said, I really think there needs to be a reason to keep going. Racking up score is cool, but maybe we can at least buy new dice with that score. Perhaps _everytime we get a certain amount of score, we get a wad of coins. We can use these coins to buy something. Abilities, dice, or something else_. 

- Just make it simple, man. I don't need to make something that's huge. This is only my _first_ commercial game. It doesn't have to be a hit. I don't have to add all that complexity. Even with this shity setup, the game is _super_ fucking fun. So, please, just make it simple and revel in the simplicity. Do not make a rogue-like, with a life sim, and some economy management sliced in. Just make a fun and relaxing game with some nice motherfucking medieval tavern music.

- Maybe this is round based? Hear me out. Every round has a certain number of points you'll have to get. After each round, you can choose to buy a certain dice that will have some kind of ability. A dice that always rolls a one? Or perhaps any specific number? An all-in-one dice that will just clear the whole entire hand? That kind of a thing. However, if you get too many farkles, you will eventually lose the round, prompting you to start over from nothing. So, fucking balatro. Fuck. Fuck you.
