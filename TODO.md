# TODO 

- You need to play a bunch of games like this in order to know what to do next...

- A state manager 

# Beautify For Playtesters

- Get a better background 

- Rotation animation 

- Better UI layout 

- Some text pop-ups for when banking the turn, continuing the turn, and so on 

- Sound effects for...
    - Choosing a die 
    - Rolling the dice 
    - Getting a farkle 
    - Getting a banking combo 
    - Banking 
    - Invalid combination of dice 
    - Invalid input 
    - Moving the cursor
    - Background music?

- A menu screen for instructions... or maybe a tutorial mode? 

- A main menu screen specifically for playtesters, allowing them to give their opinions on the game 

# Design Ideas

- End turn and end game? How will that work with a single player? Lose 100 points when there's a farkle? Tournament? 

- High score mode? (Probably should be the default until we can make sure this game is _actually_ fun)

- Combos when getting threes, fours, etc? 

- Mutiple dice types that give you different abilities?  

- I think we should have an AI that will play against the player. The KCD minigame was _SO_ fucking fun because you had to think about what your next moves are. Should you end the turn now and bank you're results, or should you perhaps keep going and hope that the gods are smiling upon ye? 

- I don't really want to make it like Balatro. I want to have a reason for you to keep going. Maybe its a tournament, or perhaps it is to pay off your debt. Just playing endlessly and seeing your points increase--while it can be fun--is quite meaningless at the end of the day. 

- I do have to make some kind of AI that will know how to play the game. Perhaps that AI will have several modes, which will essentially be dictated by the difficulty. I don't know. Prototype and find out.
