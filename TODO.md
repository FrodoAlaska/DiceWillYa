# TODO 

- Two more rules. Three pairs and sequence run

# Design Ideas

- End turn and end game? How will that work with a single player? Lose 100 points when there's a farkle? Tournament? 

- High score mode? (Probably should be the default until we can make sure this game is _actually_ fun)

- Combos when getting threes, fours, etc? 

- Higher point increases when banking less? Basically, you'll get more points if you're continuing the turn instead of banking your turn. Gambling, it's called, I believe.

- I think we should have an AI that will play against the player. The KCD minigame was _SO_ fucking fun because you had to think about what your next moves are. Should you end the turn now and bank you're results, or should you perhaps keep going and hope that the gods are smiling upon ye? 

- I don't really want to make it like Balatro. I want to have a reason for you to keep going. Maybe its a tournament, or perhaps it is to pay off your debt. Just playing endlessly and seeing your points increase--while it can be fun--is quite meaningless at the end of the day. 

- I do have to make some kind of AI that will know how to play the game. Perhaps that AI will have several modes, which will essentially be dictated by the difficulty. I don't know. Prototype and find out.
